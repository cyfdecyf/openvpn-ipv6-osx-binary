@section about About
@par
<a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/pkcs/pkcs-11">PKCS#11</a> 
is
<a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com">RSA Security</a>
published standard. PKCS#11 is the de-facto standard to access cryptographic
devices.
@par
pkcs11-helper is a library that simplifies the interaction with PKCS#11
providers for end-user applications.
@section features Features
@par
pkcs11-helper allows using multiple PKCS#11 providers at the same time, enumerating 
available token certificates, or selecting a certificate directly by serialized id,
handling card removal and card insert events, handling card re-insert to a different
slot, supporting session expiration and much more all using a simple API.
@par
pkcs11-helper is not designed to manage card content, since object attributes
are usually vendor specific, and 99% of application need to access
existing objects in order to perform signature and decryption.
@section compatibility Compatibility
- The pkcs11-helper library is available in POSIX and WIN32 compliant systems.
- The pkcs11-helper library should work with almost any PKCS#11 provider, since it
  uses the minimum required features of the PKCS#11 standard.
@section support Support
@par
pkcs11-helper support is available via the
<a href="http://www.opensc-project.org">OpenSC Project</a>.
